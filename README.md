## Abstract

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in specialized fields such as biomedical research. However, their performance is often limited by the lack of domain-specific knowledge and reasoning abilities. To address this, we introduce STELLA, a Self-Evolving LLM Agent designed for complex biomedical research tasks. STELLA leverages a novel self-evolving mechanism that enables it to continuously learn and adapt from new data and experiences. Our agent architecture integrates a dynamic knowledge base, a reasoning module, and a self-correction component, allowing it to perform intricate tasks such as literature analysis, experimental design, and data interpretation. We evaluate STELLA on a comprehensive benchmark of biomedical question-answering and research simulation tasks, demonstrating its superior performance over existing state-of-the-art models. Our results highlight the potential of self-evolving agents to accelerate biomedical discovery and innovation.
